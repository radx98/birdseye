## General Instructions

- Use bun
- Don't switch between branches

### Data source

Data is fetched from Modal. MODAL_TOKEN_ID and MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET are in the ".env" file. The fetch algorythm is already implemented for several elements on the page, which can be used as an example.

Data sample can be found in "data_sample" folder. Don't ever use it in the code, it's gonna be deleted later. It is there just to show the structure of the Modal volume that the data should be fetched from. There is also a detailed map of the data in the Modal volume in spec_data_map.md. The volume's name is 'twitter-archive-data' and it contains the saeme two user folders, 'exgenesis' and 'romeostevens76' in its root. Later there are going to be more users. If any data is missing the page should show a corresponding message.

## Layout

### "{/public/favicon.svg} Birdseye"

"Birdseye helps you explore patterns in your tweet history by automatically clustering your tweets into topics. It's powered by the [Community Archive](https://www.community-archive.org/).

Key features:
- üìä Topics are sorted by date (newest first)
- üîç Each cluster shows stats, summaries, and yearly evolution
- üìà Timeline charts help track topic engagement over time
- üßµ View full threads and conversations within each topic

Note: While most clusters are meaningful, some (especially the largest ones) may be too broad or noisy. The tool works best for exploration - try sorting by median date or likes to find interesting patterns!"
