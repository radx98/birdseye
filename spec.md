## General Instructions

- Use bun
- Don't switch between branches

### Data source

Data is fetched directly from a Supabase S3-compatible store. Credentials live in `.env` as `aws_access_key_id`, `aws_secret_access_key`, `endpoint_url`, and `region`. These credentials expose user folders right at the storage root, so no bucket name configuration is required. The fetch algorithm is already implemented across the app and can be reused as a reference.

Data sample can be found in the `data_sample` folder. Don't ever use it in the code—it will be deleted later. It only illustrates the structure stored in Supabase. There is also a detailed map of the dataset in `spec_data_map.md`. The bucket root currently contains the same two user folders, `exgenesis` and `romeostevens76`, with more to be added later. If any data is missing the page should show a corresponding message.

## Layout

### "{/public/favicon.svg} Birdseye"

"Birdseye helps you explore patterns in your tweet history by automatically clustering your tweets into topics. It's powered by the [Community Archive](https://www.community-archive.org/).

Key features:
- 📊 Topics are sorted by date (newest first)
- 🔍 Each cluster shows stats, summaries, and yearly evolution
- 📈 Timeline charts help track topic engagement over time
- 🧵 View full threads and conversations within each topic

Note: While most clusters are meaningful, some (especially the largest ones) may be too broad or noisy. The tool works best for exploration - try sorting by median date or likes to find interesting patterns!"
